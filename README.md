# Flickr Client for iOS in React Native

This iOS app uses the Flickr API to allow users to search for photos. There are options to sort search results by relevance, 
date posted, date taken, or interestingness. To run the app, you can clone this repository and open `FlickrClient.xcodeproj` in Xcode. 

```
$ open /path/to/flickr-client/ios/FlickrClient.xcodeproj
```
